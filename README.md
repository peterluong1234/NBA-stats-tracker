# NBA Stats Tracker
Track your favorite NBA players and teams by saving them to your profile! 
<br>https://nba-stats-tracker.herokuapp.com/

### Background: 
On a daily basis, I pull out my phone, open up google and type in 'NBA'. In the search results, Google shows the latest game data in a clean and easy-to-read format as compared to "Basketball-reference" or even "NBA.com". The only problem is that I have to keep typing in the team that I want to search, or I have to go through a series of tabs in order to view the relevant stats. My goal with this website is do something similar to google-where the look and feel is similar and to also add the option to pick out your players and/or teams to your favorites page.
